          Safety is the utmost concern of any marriage bureau, so is ours. We
          provide 100% privacy to the users. Users require their
          NID/Passport/Driving License number to validate their profile on the
          matchmaker site. We have features that allow the users to keep their
          photograph and contact number private from the free users. When a user
          sign-up on our marriage site, one of our customer care executives
          activates the profile upon verifying the user and their guardian
          contact number. So, if you interact with someone, you can be sure that
          you are talking or chatting with a genuine person, not a fake profile.
